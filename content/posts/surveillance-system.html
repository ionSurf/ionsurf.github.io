                    <p>This solar powered surveillance system is a
                        compilation of many others, and it was the capstone project for the UCSD
                        California IoT Specialization Program through Coursera. It combines the use of
                        embedded systems along with modern telecommunications best practices, data
                        processing, artificial intelligence, electronics and renewable energies. It
                        makes a great example of the power of the Internet of Things by integrating
                        diverse technologies into a grid of systems exchanging data between themselves.</p>

                    <h2>Approach</h2>

                    <p>In order to come up with this project, the
                        following steps were taken:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Research major system components</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Research DC components</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Purchase system components</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Build solar station</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Set up DragonBoard 410c</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>A general diagram laying out all the systems
                        that were going to be connected helped made clear what components were going to
                        be needed per cluster. This also aided into selecting the most affordable and
                        ready-to-use components, since this was meant to be a project that would
                        showcase the program member abilities. it’s important to be careful about
                        compatibility du to the many flavours of solar panels, solar charger
                        controllers, batteries and power inverters, not to mention if you want to add
                        different types of solar panels, fuses, etc.</p>

                    <p>After a prototype layout was set down and a
                        proper research was made about the components, a Bill Of Materials was done in
                        order to establish a dependency structure and a place of purchase for each one.
                        This list breaks exhibits with great detail all the ingredients needed in this
                        capstone, some of them with notes about crucial information. The majority of
                        the materials here were bought at Amazon for optimizing time and providers
                        constraints.</p>

                    <p>As the system was put together, hazardous
                        situations were avoided by being careful about polarity, overloading components
                        and weather prone accidents like water leaking or extreme heat. From beginning
                        to end, the panels, the solar charger controller, the battery and the power
                        inverter were placed first. Secondly, the desktop along with the LCD monitor,
                        the keyboard, the mouse, the camera and the lights we put into place. Then, the
                        ESP32 boards along with its sensors were assembled. Next, all the necessary
                        software was installed and the amazon account along with its instances and the
                        GreenGrass Core were setup. Finally, the implementation of AWS “Things” group,
                        the AWS services like lambdas, the DynamoDB database and the information
                        permissions were deployed.</p>

                    <h2>Systems Components</h2>

                    <p>As stated above, a BOM was created to
                        incorporate all the necessary parts for the projects. This list is available <a
                            href="">here</a>. More information about the most
                        important components will be now exposed.<sup>
                            <o:p></o:p>
                        </sup></p>

                    <h3>Solar Panels</h3>

                    <p>For this exercise, one 25W solar panel was
                        used. Nonetheless, some between 10W and 50W could be used. Two 10W solar panels
                        were recommended for the exercise, though it easier to get just one with a
                        little bit more power than those 2 combined, thus having the possibility to
                        evolve into a 50W solar panel system. This panel gives a VOC ( Open Circuit
                        Voltage ) of 21.6V and an ISC ( Short Circuit Current ) of 1.22 A. The original
                        recipe suggested a VOC of 20,6 and an ISC of 1.38 A if connected in parallel.
                        It’s important to mention that the more amperage we have, the faster the
                        batteries will be charged, thus keeping a more stable voltage.</p>

                    <h3>Solar Charge Controller</h3>

                    <p>The solar charge controller has a 20A max
                        output, with USB ports too. It can hold up to 12V or 24V depending on the
                        settings. This is actually a very affordable and good controller for our
                        purposes.</p>

                    <h3>Power Inverter</h3>

                    <p>A standard car power inverter was selected to
                        source the station. It can provide up to 300W, connecting a 12V DC power source
                        and turning it into a 110AC. It comes with a 4.2A Dual USB charging ports.</p>

                    <h3>Battery</h3>

                    <p>The system’s battery is a 12V 20AH one,
                        meaning it can give up to 20A per hour. This must be taken into consideration
                        while thinking about the charge controller and the power inverter, thus making
                        sure that it doesn’t overload by the payload and it doesn’t drain too fast. An
                        easy calculation summing up the approximate power consumed by each element in
                        the system can give you a fair estimate.</p>

                    <h2>Assembly</h2>

                    <h3>Solar Energy Grid</h3>

                    <p>Depending on your calculations, solar panels
                        should be set either in parallel for more current or in series for more
                        voltage. For the sake of this exercise, only one will be used, but if two were
                        to be coupled, they’ll definitely be in parallel, thus giving more amps to the
                        controller. Cables should be connected using the ring connectors, that’ll
                        simplify the screwing. If using different cable colors than black and red, make
                        sure you remember which one is the positive and the negative end.</p>

                    <p>The panels should be attached to the mobile
                        box on the top using screws, keeping together their cables with either tape or
                        a plastic zip belt that should be also tied up to the box. Making a small hole
                        big enough for the cables to go through is also a good idea. </p>

                    <p>Only one pair of cables should run from the
                        panel grid arrangement to the charge controlled, taking polarity into
                        consideration. Connect the positive cable from the panel grid into the positive
                        input of the charge controller and do the same for the negative end.</p>

                    <p>The battery, the inverter and the charge
                        controller are meant to live inside the box because that’ll keep them safe and
                        dry. The battery must be connected to the charge controller too, using the
                        positive end for the positive input of the controller and the negative end to
                        the negative probe of the controller. Next, the battery must be connected to
                        the power inverter, tying up positive to positive and negative to negative.
                        It’s very important to know if the battery comes charged or not. Sometimes they
                        do and might give a shock.</p>

                    <p>After all is set, it’s a good idea to check
                        all connections using a multimeter. This phase of the installation is finished
                        by connecting an outlet to the power inverter.</p>

                    <h3>Remote Desktop</h3>

                    <p>The remote desktop consists of the
                        DragonBoard, the LCD screen, the mouse, the keyboard, the camera, the sensors
                        attached to the mezzanine and the exterior lights. This section is began by
                        connecting the DragonBoard. Attach the LCD screen to the DragonBoard using the
                        HDMI cable, then the keyboard, the mouse and the camera using their respective
                        USB cables. Lastly, connect the board’s AC/DC power converter to the board and
                        then to the power outlet. Press the on button.</p>

                    <p>Check that the DragonBoard is actually on and
                        that it’s running smoothly in case there’s an OS installed. Otherwise, that’ll
                        be done later. Then, connect the lights to the power outlet and turn them on
                        just to check if they are working properly.</p>

                    <h3>IoT Units</h3>

                    <p>The ESP32 units are meant to be connected with
                        the humidity, temperature, light and sound sensors.</p>
